## Course Policies
### Academic dishonesty
Adherence to the Duke Community Standard is expected. To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors; \
I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and \
I will act if the Standard is compromised

Anyone found in violation of the Standard will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.

### Class Attendance
Attending class is a vital component of the course as it is one of the multiple ways in which you will interact with and learn course material. In person class attendance is therefore expected for this course. For any special circumstances, please reach out to the course instructor.

### Sick absences
To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, please do not come to class if you have cold symptoms. Please inform me of your absence and plan to complete any missed work. Students who encounter short- and long-term medical issues or instances of personal distress or emergency can seek academic support if needed. *Recordings of the class will be available for excused absences*.

### Accommodations and accessibility
If you need special accommodations due to physical or learning disabilities, medical needs, religious practices, or other reasons, please inform us as soon as possible so we can work to accommodate those needs.

If you are a student with a disability and need accommodations for this class, please register with the [Student Disability Access Office](https://access.duke.edu/students) (SDAO) and provide them with documentation of your disability. SDAO will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to your instructor. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or [](access.duke.edu).

### Late Submissions
Assignments and projects are due in class by the start of class on the date posted. Late deliverables will ONLY be accepted at the discretion of the instructor and according to the following:

- Course **projects deliverables** will not be accepted after the deadline. 
- Late **assignment** submissions will result in a reduction of 5 points off the grade per day late. 
- **Quizzes** will not be accepted after the deadline since the answers to the quizzes are made available after the class in which they're due. Quizzes are typically posted a week or more in advance, so you are encouraged to start early. Quizzes cannot be made up.

Please reach out to the TA's or instructor as early as possible to request any special accommodations.

### Collaboration

There will be three modes of collaboration ranging from fully-collaborative group projects, to fully-independent work. The three modes are as follows, and will be indicated throughout the course:

- Mode 1: Team-based Assignment. Collaboration is expected with every member of the team contributing to a single deliverable. **Applies to the Project**
- Mode 2: Individual Assignment – Collaboration Permitted. Students hand in *individual* work, but they may work with others if they provide citations of the help they received, such as a list of people who assisted/collaborated with them to produce the final product. Duplication or copying is not permissible, even in part, and constitutes a breach of the honor code. **Applies to Assignments**
- Mode 3: Individual Assignment – No Collaboration Permitted. Students hand in individual work that is completed entirely independent of any discussion or help from other students. Clarifying questions to teaching assistants and instructors are both permissible and encouraged. **Applies to Quizzes**

### Rules for recording course content
Student recording recordings of lectures must be permitted by the instructor prior to recording and shall be for private study only. Such recordings shall not be distributed to anyone without authorization by the instructor whose lecture has been recorded. However, the instructor may arrange through the Office of Information Technology to make recorded lectures available to students enrolled in the class on such terms and conditions as he or she prescribes. Redistribution of recorded lectures is prohibited. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board. The full policy on recoding of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, [available here](https://policies.provost.duke.edu/docs/faculty-handbook-appendix-m-intellectual-property#:~:text=In%20this%20Policy%20Duke%20reaffirms,defined%20for%20purposes%20of%20this).
