Below is a step-by-step guide to submitting your assignments.\n\nHeader. At the top of the document, include the assignment number, your name, your netid, and a list of anyone you collaborated with on the assignment.\nEach answer is prefaced in bold by the question/subquestion number. Each question is followed by one or more sections typically labeled with section numbers (e.g. 2.3). Make sure you have a cell with that section number prior to your response. You may use multiple cells for each answer that include both markdown and code. For full credit, submitted assignments should be easily navigable with answers for subsections clearly indicated.\nEnsure that all cells have been run. Cells that have not been run will be treated as unanswered questions and assigned zero points.\nCreate a PDF document of your notebook. There are a few ways to do this. Please see the guide below.\nYour content is legible prior to submission. Look over your PDF before you submit it. If we cannot read it, or parts are missing, we cannot grade it, and no credit will be given for anything we cannot read or is missing.\n\nCode is valid (able to run and producing the correct answer), neat, understandable, and well commented.\nMath is either clearly written and inserted into the proper part of the document or typeset using LateX equations.\nAll text that is not code should be formatted using markdown. Two references to help include: ref1 and ref2.\n\nSubmit your assignment by the deadline on gradescope. Any assignments received after the deadline will be treated as late. Please see this video for how to submit your assignment on gradescope. The submission link is here: https://www.gradescope.com/\nAssign the respective pages to each question. When you submit your assignment on Gradescope, you will be asked to assign pages of your PDF to each question accordingly. Be sure to leave time to complete this before submission. Please remember, if we cannot find your answer, we cannot grade it.",

Rendering pdfs from Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code has a couple of extra steps, though. To render a pdf without any additional extensions, you do the following:\n\nOpen your notebook in VS code and hit the ellipsis (the three horizontal dots) just to the right of the tools for your notebook:\n\n\n\nClick “Export”:\n\n\n\nSelect “HTML” (exporting to pdf won’t work without the installation of additional tools):\n\n\n\nOpen the HTML file you just saved in Chrome:\n\n\n\nClick the options button (three vertical dots) and click “print”:\n\n\n\nSelect the destination as “Save as PDF” and click “Save”:\n\n\n\nVoila! You should have a pdf\n\n\n\nOption 2: Render from VS Code with Quarto and LaTeX\nYou can save a lot of the above steps if you’re willing to install 2 things: 1. Install Quarto, which is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system (great for making websites and blogs for your professional portfolio). 2. Install the Quarto VS Code extension 3. Install a version of tex for your operating system. 4. Once you do this, you can directly export your documents to pdf:\n\n\n\nOption 3: Render from Jupyter Notebooks\nOpen your notebook in a Jupyter Notebook in Google Chrome. Go to File-&gt;Print Preview, then after verifying the document looks correct, click “print” and for your printer choose “Save as PDF.”\nWhichever method you choose - always check your pdf before submitting to make sure everything is rendered and nothing is cut off!",

    "section": "Figure Guidelines",
    "text": "Figure Guidelines\nHere is an example of a well-prepared figure that checks all of the requirements for good figures. Please check out this Coursera course for skill development and Python plotting best practices.\n\nFigure checklist\n\nAll plots should have a purpose - either being directly requested or should make a clear point.\nAll plots should have axes labels and legible fonts (large enough to read).\nLegends are used when there are multiple series plotted on a single plot.\nMarkers on plots are properly sized (e.g. not be too big nor too small) and/or have the appropriate level of transparency to be able to clearly read the data without obscuring other data.\nIf there are multiple colors used on a plot, EVERY color can be distinguished from the rest.\nFigures are crisp and clear - there are no blurry figures.\nPlots should be explained clearly in text or have a caption explaining them\n\nTo demonstrate we’ll start by loading some data to plot (the example here is from the lecture on the bias-variance tradeoff):\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pickle\n\n# Load the data for plotting\ndatafilename = './plot_example_data/data.pkl'\ninfile = open(datafilename,'rb')\nloaded_data = pickle.load(infile)\ninfile.close()\n\n# Store the loaded data in convenient variable names\nkvalues = loaded_data['kvalues']\nerror_training = loaded_data['error_training']\nerror_testing = loaded_data['error_testing']\nerror_bayesclf = loaded_data['error_bayesclf']\n\n# Choose colors that will be distinguishable from one another\ncolor0 = '#121619' # Dark grey\ncolor1 = '#00B050' # Green\ncolor2 = '#7c7c7c' # Light grey\n\nThen, we create the plot:\n\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' # Make clear on high-res screens\n\n# Create the plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,5), dpi= 100) # Adjust the figure size and dots per inch to make it legible and clear \nax.semilogx(kvalues,error_training,\n            color=color0,\n            label='Training (in-sample)')\nax.semilogx(kvalues,error_testing,\n            color=color1,\n            label='Test (out-of-sample)')\nax.semilogx(kvalues,error_bayesclf,'--',\n            color=color2,\n            label='Bayes (optimal)')\nax.legend()\nax.grid('on')\nax.set_xlabel('k nearest neighbors') # Always use X and Y labels\nax.set_ylabel('Binary Classification Error Rate')\nax.set_xlim([1,200]) # Ensure the axis is the right size for the plot data\nax.set_ylim([0,0.5])\nfig.tight_layout() # Use this to maximize the use of space in the figure\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Ideally, each figure should have a caption that explains the figure. Here, the test data (green) approximates the generalization error rate, the lower-bound of which is the Bayes error rate (grey dotted line). The value of \\(k\\) represents the flexibility of the model with lower values of \\(k\\) representing higher model flexibility and higher values of \\(k\\), lower flexibility. The training error (black) is not considered out of sample, so in cases of high model flexiblity (and in this case high overfit), the training error rate can reach zero.\nNote the clear x and y axis labels and legends - there are no acronyms or shorthands used, just the full description of what is being plotted. Also note how easy it is to compare the color of lines and identify the baseline (Bayes) comparison line. Make your plots easy to read and understand. A figure caption is generally helpful as well to indicate what we are seeing in each plot.",

To uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\nAnyone found in violation of the Standard will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nClass Attendance\nAttending class is a vital component of the course as it is one of the multiple ways in which you will interact with and learn course material. In person class attendance is therefore expected for this course. For any special circumstances, please reach out to the course instructor.\n\n\nSick absences\nTo keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, please do not come to class if you have cold symptoms. Please inform me of your absence and plan to complete any missed work. Students who encounter short- and long-term medical issues or instances of personal distress or emergency can seek academic support if needed. Recordings of the class will be available for excused absences.\n\n\nAccommodations and accessibility\nIf you need special accommodations due to physical or learning disabilities, medical needs, religious practices, or other reasons, please inform us as soon as possible so we can work to accommodate those needs.\nIf you are a student with a disability and need accommodations for this class, please register with the Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) and provide them with documentation of your disability. SDAO will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to your instructor. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or .\n\n\nLate Submissions\nAssignments and projects are due in class by the start of class on the date posted. Late deliverables will ONLY be accepted at the discretion of the instructor and according to the following:\n\nCourse projects deliverables will not be accepted after the deadline.\nLate assignment submissions will result in a reduction of 5 points off the grade per day late.\nQuizzes will not be accepted after the deadline since the answers to the quizzes are discussed in and made available after the class in which they’re due. Quizzes are typically posted a week or more in advance, so you are encouraged to start early (you can submit as early as you’d like). Quizzes cannot be made up, but there will be an opportunity later in the semester to make up a quiz to account for any off days.\n\nPlease reach out to the TA’s or instructor as early as possible to request any special accommodations.\n\n\nCollaboration\nThere will be three modes of collaboration ranging from fully-collaborative group projects, to fully-independent work. The three modes are as follows, and will be indicated throughout the course:\n\nMode 1: Team-based Assignment. Collaboration is expected with every member of the team contributing to a single deliverable. Applies to the Project\nMode 2: Individual Assignment – Some collaboration is permitted. Students hand in individual work, but they may work with others (at the level of ideas rather than implementation) if they provide citations of the help they received, such as a list of people who assisted/collaborated with them to produce the final product. Duplication or copying is never permissible, even in part, and constitutes a breach of the honor code. This means that all work should in assignments should be your own. Applies to Assignments\nMode 3: Individual Assignment – No collaboration permitted. Students hand in individual work that is completed entirely independent of any discussion or help from other students. Clarifying questions to teaching assistants and instructors are both permissible and encouraged. Applies to Quizzes\n\n\n\nRules for recording course content\nStudent recording recordings of lectures must be permitted by the instructor prior to recording and shall be for private study only. Such recordings shall not be distributed to anyone without authorization by the instructor whose lecture has been recorded. However, the instructor may arrange through the Office of Information Technology to make recorded lectures available to students enrolled in the class on such terms and conditions as he or she prescribes. Redistribution of recorded lectures is prohibited. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board. The full policy on recoding of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available here.",

    "text": "Learning Objectives\nThis is an opportunity to creatively deploy machine learning in an application area of interest to you. A central component of your project must be a machine learning methodology. It does not have to be one that we’ve explicitly discussed in class as you’re welcome to use the project as an opportunity to learn new topics, although there should be a supervised learning component to your project. The objectives of this project are to…\n\nDevelop deeper competency in applying machine learning methods in practical applications\nGain experience in learning more about a topic beyond what was explicitly discussed, but by building on the foundation you have developed throughout the course which enables you to learn about other machine learning concepts\nIncrease your experience with collaborative data science workflows\nExpand your data science portfolio\n\nIn this project you will use what you’ve learned throughout this course and build on that knowledge and experience to apply the paradigms, algorithms, evaluation tools, and interpretation techniques discussed throughout the course. I strongly encourage you to pick a project that is of genuine interest in some way (e.g. the application, the tools, the dataset, etc.). Learning comes from stretching yourself: this requires that you push yourself into some unfamiliar territory and that is often a challenge and leads to desirable difficulty. Through this struggle is how the best learning happens, but it requires perseverance and that is best achieved when you are able to bring intrinsic motivation to that challenge. Find a topic of interest and embrace the challenge!\nFor this project you will identify a problem you wish to solve using machine learning tools. Identify the experiment you would need to run to evaluate how well you solved it as compared to existing approaches in the field including what metrics to use to evaluate performance.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe project must involve supervised machine learning. You may include concepts we were not able to cover in the course. You may include other concepts at well, but there should be a supervised learning component.\nThe project must be able to be completed within the course of this semester and should be scoped correctly: we encourage you to be ambitious, but please visit office hours if you have questions about project scope.\nEvery project should involve learning more about both your application domain and the methods that you’re using. This means reading about both facets. If you’re working on a project involving diagnosis of a disease, you should read enough to understand the disease and how it manifests the symptoms that your data may be noting. You’re expected to develop some domain knowledge related to your problem and demonstrate that in the report.\nAt minimum, your project should have at least one experimental design or study per student on the team. Examples include (but are not limited to): Options for topics to investigate:\n\nCross-domain comparison. What is the impact on generalization performance if we know that the conditions under which we will apply our ML approach are different than the available training data (e.g. if I’m working on a computer vision problem and all my training data are from the U.S., but the goal is to apply the model to regions in Asia)\nModel sensitivity to imbalanced data. What if training data when the training data are not perfectly sampled to be representative of the actual target data. This could be an investigation of the impact and possible solutions to imbalanced datasets.\nActive learning for cases where collecting data is expensive. How little additional data do you need to add to your model and how might it be identified how to sample the new data.\nBias detection and mitigation - could the fairness of algorithms be analyzed across different subsets of the data.\nModel explainability / interpretability.\nModel robustness to noise and/or adversarial attacks\nModel robustness when the application domain will likely be shifted from the training domain\nWhen do ensembles actually help? Investigating model stacking and the conditions under which it is adventageous (performance / computation tradeoff)\nCalibration in classification models - do the confidence scores match the actual probabilities?\n\nYour project should consider the potential ethical implications of your work and describe how that was factored into your work."

How well do interpretable machine learning techniques perform in predicting recidivism as compared to less interpretable or explainable methodologies?\nReproduce the work of a published study and build on it. Reproducing the results of a journal article can be a great way to dive into advanced materials. The goal for a project like this would be to reproduce the study and build on it in some way: test a new hypothesis, adjust the methodology, try it on other data that may present new and interesting challenges. Reproducing papers can be hard, so you’ll want to choose wisely and make clear what your innovation will be. As a starting place, you can explore Papers with Code which typically have papers where the code and the data are both shared, often making reproducing their work simpler.\nParticipate in an active machine learning competition. Online machine learning competitions are sponsored by organizations with a significantly high interest in a problem that they are investing prize money into finding a solution. Examples of competition platforms include Kaggle, Driven Data, Zindi, AICrowd, etc. If you choose to participate in a competition, it must be an active competition where your team can compete; it cannot be a “sample” competition that is only for learning to use the platform (e.g. the Kaggle Titanic competition, etc.). You will want to learn about the application domain.\nBuild your own tool. Great value can come from making a tool available for use, but building the infrastructure is a challenge. You may want to create a chatbot that creates poetry based on themes that you feed in, or design a search tool that scans satellite data of the Earth for signs of natural disasters. The key here is that your tool will need to be functional and usable by your target audience. For this path, part of your output should be a demonstration of your tool."

This course will begin with exploring the purpose of machine learning told through a discussion of the types of problems that machine learning can answer: describing, predicting, and strategizing based on data and the tools at our disposal to address these challenges: supervised learning including classification and regression; unsupervised learning including clustering and density estimation; and reinforcement learning. There will be a strong focus on how to formulate a machine learning problem. Central to that formulation will be developing an understanding of how to preprocess data for analysis (e.g. feature extraction/dimensionality reduction, training/validation data sampling), model selection, and performance evaluation with cross validation. The final topic of this course will be a brief overview of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that are emerging in the field.\nThroughout this course, the focus will be on applying algorithms rather than diving deeply into theory. You will be asked to consider the practical issues of machine learning problem solving: challenges of applying machine learning code packages, striving for parsimony (simplicity of models) and interpretability, and ensuring model assumptions are valid for a given problem and dataset. This course will also stress the importance of team-based collaboration, the value of producing fully reproducible and validated results, and tools to help with both such as version control and code repositories.\nCommunicating your results. Data science solutions are only as impactful as the communicator who shares them: therefore communication of your findings will be a core component of this course. Demonstrating competency in data science means (a) exhibiting a working knowledge of technical concepts including programming, statistics, and mathematics and (b) being able to clearly communicate the problem you were trying to solve or question you were trying to answer, why it matters, and how well your analysis worked. You will have opportunities to practice these skills throughout this course in the context of interpreting and sharing the results of your analyses.",

Don’t let the AI tool do a task for your, but allow the tool to help you connect with the knowledge and resources you need to complete the task and develop new skills (always search for high-quality resources before relying on AI directly).\nA coding aid. For coding, consider AI to be a pair programmer who may have some suggestions to enhance your coding or may be able to provide some templates to work from. DO NOT directly copy and paste code from AI tools. You should fully understand and be capable of reproducing any code segment that you use - if not, you have not learned the material and that is considered plagiarism.\nA brainstorming aid. AI can help you to think through and generate ideas. However, always begin creating ideas on your own first, and use AI after you’ve done some critical thinking on your own to prevent your own creativity and problem solving skills from atrophying.\nA tool for detecting spelling and grammar issues (e.g., Grammarly)\n\nYou should NEVER directly submit work that was created by AI.

Desirable difficulties help you build connections between concepts and learn representations of knowledge (meta-cognition) that, like an index of a book, will increase your ability to creatively connect concepts and think more deeply about the topic.\n\n\nTenet #3: Read, reflect, recall is a pattern for effective learning\nSpaced retrieval and reflection is a key to effective learning. When we learn something, if we don’t use it, the knowledge fades. However, if we return to the material, apply it, create with it, we’re increasing the probability of long-term learning. This is why you will interact with each concept typically 4 times: lectures, readings, quizzes, and assignments, and at least one more time for those concepts involved in the final project. An added benefit of the frequent reflection through quizzes is that it tests your knowledge regularly, helping us to avoid the illusion of knowledge (thinking we know something, when we actually do not).\nReference\nBrown, P.C., Roediger III, H.L. and McDaniel, M.A., 2014.

There are many configurations that may work for you, but I would recommend begin by gathering ideas in Jupyter Notebooks. Once you have the basic structure of your code worked out, consider moving it to a .py file to make it easier and cleaner to run and build on.\nIf you could use help getting started or a refresher on Jupyter notebooks, check out this video for more on basic Jupyter functionality. Using Jupyter notebooks allows you to practice applying machine learning concepts while building programming and writing skills, strengthening your ability to both create creative solutions to machine learning challenges while simultaneously enhancing your ability to communicate the meaning behind your findings and why others should give credence to your results.

You can even use some Git repositories (e.g. Github) as hosts for website, such as with the course website. As a data scientist with experience in machine learning, Git is expected. We will interact with Git repositories (a.k.a. repos) throughout this course, and your project will require the use of git repos for collaboration.\nComplete the Atlassian Git tutorial, specifically the following listed sections. Try each concept that’s presented. For this tutorial, instead of using BitBucket as your remote repository host, you may use your preferred platform such as Github or Duke’s Gitlab. 1. What is version control 2. What is Git 3. Install Git 4. Setting up a repository 5. Saving changes 6. Inspecting a repository 7. Undoing changes 8. Rewriting history 9. Syncing 10. Making a pull request 11. Using branches 12. Comparing workflows\nI also have created two videos on the topic to help you understand some of these concepts: Git basics and a step-by-step tutorial.\nAs an additional resource, Microsoft now offers a git tutorial on this topic as well.\nFor your answer, affirm that you either completed the tutorials above OR have previous experience with ALL of the concepts above. Confirm this by typing your name below and selecting the situation that applies from the two options in brackets.",
