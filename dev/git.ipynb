    "\n",
    "Git is efficient for collaboration, and expectation in industry, and one of the best ways to share results in academia. You can even use some Git repositories (e.g. Github) as hosts for website, such as with the [course website](https://kylebradbury.github.io/ids705/index.html). As a data scientist with experience in machine learning, Git is expected. We will interact with Git repositories (a.k.a. repos) throughout this course, and your project will require the use of git repos for collaboration.\n",
