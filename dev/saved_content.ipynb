    "## Problem 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you'll bring together some of the individual skills that you demonstrated above and create a Jupyter notebook based blog post on your exploratory data analysis. Your goal is to identify a question or problem and to work towards solving it or providing additional information or evidence (data) related to it through your data analysis. Below, we walk through a process to follow for your analysis. Additionally, you can find an [example of a well-done exploratory data analysis here from past years](https://github.com/kylebradbury/ids705/blob/master/assignments/Assignment_1_Q12_Example.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a dataset that interests you and relates to a question or problem that you find intriguing.\n",
    "2. Describe the dataset, the source of the data, and the reason the dataset was of interest. Include a description of the features, data size, data creator and year of creation (if available), etc. What question are you hoping to answer through exploring the dataset?\n",
    "3. Check the data and see if they need to be cleaned: are there missing values? Are there clearly erroneous values? Do two tables need to be merged together? Clean the data so it can be visualized. If the data are clean, state how you know they are clean (what did you check?).\n",
    "3. Plot the data, demonstrating interesting features that you discover. Are there any relationships between variables that were surprising or patterns that emerged? Please exercise creativity and curiosity in your plots. You should have at least 4 plots exploring the data in different ways.\n",
    "4. What insights are you able to take away from exploring the data? Is there a reason why analyzing the dataset you chose is particularly interesting or important? Summarize this for a general audience (imagine your publishing a blog post online) - boil down your findings in a way that is accessible, but still accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here your analysis will evaluated based on:\n",
    "1. Motivation: was the purpose of the choice of data clearly articulated? Why was the dataset chosen and what was the goal of the analysis?\n",
    "2. Data cleaning: were any issues with the data investigated and, if found, were they resolved?\n",
    "3. Quality of data exploration: were at least 4 unique plots (minimum) included and did those plots demonstrate interesting aspects of the data? Was there a clear purpose and takeaway from EACH plot? \n",
    "4. Interpretation: Were the insights revealed through the analysis and their potential implications clearly explained? Was there an overall conclusion to the analysis?"
