They're open 8 hours a day and the maximum wait time is 8 hours (we won't assume it's possible not to be seen, assuming you're willing to wait). Define the continuous random variable $X = [\\text{wait time for service as a fraction of 8 hours}]$ . This means that $x=1$ represents a full day's wait, or 8 hours, $x=0.5$ represents half a day wait or 4 hours. Additionally, the valid values of $X$ are between 0 and 1 ($0\\leq x \\leq 1$).\n",

Be sure to indicate the value of the CDF for all values of $x\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$.\n",

If you are using a vector, make sure the dimensions of the vector match what you'd expect, for example, matrix $\\mathbf{b}$ is a $[2 \\times 1]$ vector. In NumPy, unless you're specify, you'll like create a one-dimensional array of length 2 rather than a $[2 \\times 1]$ vector if you don't specify - be careful of this potential pitfall. Refer to NumPy's tools for handling matrices. There may be circumstances when Python **will** produce an output, but based on the dimensions of the matrices involved, the linear algebra operation is not possible. ***Note these cases and explain why they occur***. Please provide both the Python code AND the output of that code showing your result.\n",

Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular, which implies that their inner product is zero. A unit vector is of length 1 (meaning its $L_2$ norm is 1). We frequently encounter orthogonal and orthonormal vectors when dealing with dimensionality reduction, for example in Principal Components Analysis.\n",

    "**3E. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues**. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are useful for some machine learning algorithms, but the concepts take time to solidly grasp. They are used extensively in machine learning including in Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms. For an intuitive review of these concepts, explore this [interactive website at Setosa.io](http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/). Also, the series of linear algebra videos by Grant Sanderson of 3Brown1Blue are excellent and can be viewed on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

    "3. Show that the eigenvectors are orthogonal to one another (e.g. their inner product is zero - just compute the inner product and show it is approximately 0). This is true for eigenvectors from real, symmetric matrices. In three dimensions or less, this means that the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. Typically we use the orthogonal basis of our standard x, y, and z, Cartesian coordinates, which allows us, if we combine them linearly, to represent any point in a 3D space. But any three orthogonal vectors can do the same. This property is used, for example, in PCA to identify the dimensions of greatest variation."
